  headerText: `The layout system is the heart of every application. Below are the officially supported examples, ranging from desktop to mobile applications. While Vuetify.js aims to be as un-opinionated as possible, the layout structure must be <strong>explicitly</strong> followed to receive the expected results.`,

  markupText: `This is an example of the default application markup for Vuetify. You can place your layout elements anywhere, as long as you designate them with the <strong>app</strong> property. The key component in all of this is the <code>v-content</code> element. This will be dynamically sized depending upon the structure of your designated <strong>app</strong> components. This allows you to create extremely customed solutions.`,
  appHeader: 'All about <em>app</em>',
  appText: `In Vuetify, the <code>v-app</code> component and the <strong>app</strong> help bootstrap your application with the proper sizing around <code>v-content</code>. This allows you to create truly unique interfaces without the hassle of managing your layout. The <code>v-app</code> component is <strong>REQUIRED</strong> for all applications. This is the mount point for many of Vuetify's components and functionality.`,
  alert1: `In order for your application to work properly, you <strong>must</strong> wrap it in a <code>v-app</code> component. This component is required for determining grid breakpoints for the layout. This can exist <strong>anywhere</strong> inside the body, but must be the parent of <strong>ALL</strong> Vuetify components.`,
