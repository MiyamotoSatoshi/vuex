## Purpose:

The purpose of the Vuetify Beginner's Guide is to provide a comprehensive and diverse approach to welcoming beginner to intermediate level web developers into the Vuetify Ecosystem. We aim to accomplish this by having a broad variety of contributors creating content including (but not limited to):

- Blog Posts covering Vuetify specific and ecosystem topics
- Tutorials that teach how to use Vuetify effectively
- A glossary that covers essential terms with examples as needed

*All content is reviewed by the Vuetify Core Team as well as Webdev beginners. We encourage feedback if further clarification, or a deeper dive into any and all concepts presented within this guide.*
