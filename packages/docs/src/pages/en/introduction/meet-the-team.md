# Meet the team

Vuetify is _not_ a one person show. We have a very active and engaged team that is **constantly striving** to bring developers a better experience. Keep in mind the below is not an exhaustive list of all the individuals that help make Vuetify great. **Thank you** for your support and thank you for using Vuetify!

## Company

While Vuetify (the framework) is [MIT Licensed](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), Vuetify (the company) is owned and operated by John and Heather Leider as a full-time Open Source business. You can support them by sponsoring Vuetify on **GitHub**.
