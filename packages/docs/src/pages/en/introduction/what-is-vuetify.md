## What is Vuetify?

Vuetify is a complete UI framework built on top of Vue.js. The goal of the project is to provide developers with tools to build rich and engaging user experiences. Unlike other frameworks, Vuetify is designed from the ground up to be easy to learn and rewarding to master with hundreds of carefully crafted components from the [Material Design](https://material.io/) specification.

Vuetify takes a mobile first approach to design which means your application just works out of the boxâ€”whether it's on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer. Over

If you are an experienced developer and want to compare Vuetify to other libraries/frameworks, check out our [Why Vuetify?](/introduction/why-vuetify/) page.

## Getting started

The easiest way to try Vuetify is to use our [Codepen Template](https://template.vuetifyjs.com/). This template is used by all examples within the documentation and is the perfect sandbox to play with the framework. If you prefer to use a local `index.html` file, we have a guide on how to [install via CDN](/getting-started/installation/#cdn-usage).

For additional installation options such as **Nuxt** and **Vuepress**,  visit the [Installation](/getting-started/installation/) page.
