# Forms

When it comes to form validation, Vuetify has a multitude of integrations and baked in functionality. Want to use a 3rd party validation plugin? Out of the box you can use [Vee-validate](https://github.com/baianat/Vee-validate) and [vuelidate](https://github.com/vuelidate/vuelidate).

## Usage

The `v-form` component makes it easy to add validation to form inputs. All input components have a **rules** prop that can be used to specify conditions in which the input is either *valid* or *invalid*.

Whenever the value of an input is changed, each rule will receive the new value and be re-evaluated. If a rule returns `false` or a `string`, validation has failed and the `string` value will be presented as an error message.

## API

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| [v-form](/api/v-form/) | Primary Component |

## Rules

Rules allow you to apply custom validation on all form components. These are validated sequentially, and components will display a *maximum* of 1 error at a time, so make sure you order your rules accordingly.

The most basic of rules is a simple function that checks if an input has a value or not, i.e. it makes it a required input.

<example file="v-form/rules-required" />

However rules a can be as complicated as you need them to be, including the ability to validate inputs asynchronously. In the below example we are checking the input against a fake API service that takes some time to respond. The `submit` event is a Promise that you can wait for.

This also demonstrates the **validate-on** prop, which tells the `v-form` component when validation should happen. Here we set it to `'submit'` so that we only call the API service when the button is clicked.

<example file="v-form/rules-async" />

## Examples

### Props

#### Disabled

You can easily disable all input components in a `v-form` by setting the **disabled** prop.

<example file="v-form/prop-disabled" />

#### Fast fail

When the **fast-fail** prop is set, validation will short-circuit after the first invalid input is found. This can be useful if some of your rules are computationally heavy and can take a long time. In this example, notice how when the submit button is clicked, the second input does not show validation errors even though it does not satisfy the rules.

<example file="v-form/prop-fast-fail" />

### Misc

#### Exposed properties

The `v-form` component has a number of exposed properties that can be accessed by setting a **ref** on the component. A ref allows us to access internal methods on a component. You can find all of them on the API page, but some of the more commonly used ones are `validate()`, `reset()`, and `resetValidation()`.

The difference between `reset()` and `resetValidation()` is that the former resets both input values and validation state, while the latter only resets validation state.
