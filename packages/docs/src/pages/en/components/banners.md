# Banners

The `v-banner` component is used as a middle-interrupting message to the user with one to two actions. It comes in two variations **single-line** and **multi-line** (implicit). These can have icons and actions that you can use with your message. Note that only one banner should be shown at a time.

## Usage

Banners can contain one to two lines of text, to which actions and icons can be added.

| - | - |

## Anatomy

The recommended placement of elements inside of `v-banner` is:

* Place a `v-banner-avatar` or `v-banner-icon` on the far left
* Place `v-banner-text` to the right of any visual content
* Place `v-banner-actions` to the far right of textual content, offset bottom

## Examples

### Props

#### Lines

The prop **lines** can be used to specify how the displayed text should be handled based on its length.

<example file="v-banner/prop-lines" />

#### Sticky

You can optionally turn on the **sticky** prop to ensure that the content is pinned to the top of the screen.

<example file="v-banner/prop-sticky" />

### Slots

#### Actions

Banners may have one or two text buttons that don't stand out that much.

<example file="v-banner/slot-actions" />

#### Icon

The icon slot allows you to to explicitly control the content and functionality within it.

<example file="v-banner/slot-icon" />

#### Prepend

The prepend slot allows you to to explicitly control the content and functionality within it. Icons also help to emphasize a banner's message.
