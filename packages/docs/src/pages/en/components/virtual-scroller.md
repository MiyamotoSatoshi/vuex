# Virtual scrollers

The `v-virtual-scroll` component displays a virtual, _infinite_ list. It supports dynamic height and scrolling vertically and is a good alternative to pagination.

----

## Usage

The virtual scroller displays just enough records to fill the viewport and uses the existing component, rehydrating it with new data.

<usage name="v-virtual-scroll" />

<entry />

## Anatomy

The `v-virtual-scroll` component contains only a default slot with no styling options.

| Element / Area | Description |
| - | - |
| 1. Container | The rendered content area from the provided [items](/api/v-virtual-scroll/#props-items) prop |

## API

| Component | Description |
| - | - |
| [v-virtual-scroll](/api/v-virtual-scroll/) | Primary Component |
| [v-virtual-scroll-item](/api/v-virtual-scroll-item) | Wraps content and communicates height to parent |

<api-inline hide-links />

## Guide

The `v-virtual-scroll` allows you to display thousands of records on a single page without the performance hit of actually showing all of them at once. `v-virtual-scroll` is devoid of styling and pairs well with components such as [v-card](/components/cards/) to provide a better visual experience.

### Props

The `v-virtual-scroll` component has a small API mainly used to configure the root and item height.

#### Height

The `v-virtual-scroll` component does not have any initial height set on itself.

The following code snippet uses the **height** prop:

<example file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-height" />

Another way of making sure that the component has height is to place it inside an element with `display: flex`.

<example file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-height-parent" />

#### Item Height

For lists where the item height is static and uniform for all items, it's recommended that you define a specific **item-height**. This value is used for `v-virtual-scroll`'s calculations.

<example file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-item-height" />

If your items are not of a uniform size, omit the **item-height** prop to have `v-virtual-scroll` dynamically calculate each item.

<example file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-dynamic-item-height" />

#### Visible items

The `v-virtual-scroll` component renders a set amount of visible items, meant to cover the viewport of the scroller, plus some amount of buffer above and below it so that scrolling looks and feels smooth. Modify this value by using the **visible-items** prop.

<example file="v-virtual-scroll/prop-visible-items" />

<alert type="info">

  Depending on the size of the scroll container, the size of the items, and the complexity of what you are rendering, adjusting the **visible-items** might improve the performance of the scrolling.

</alert>

### Examples

The following is a collection of `v-virtual-scroll` examples that demonstrate how different the properties work in an application.

#### User Directory

The v-virtual-scroll component can render an large amount of items by rendering only what it needs to fill the scrollerâ€™s viewport.

<example file="v-virtual-scroll/misc-user-directory" />
