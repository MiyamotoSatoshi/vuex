# Hover

The `v-hover` component provides a simple interface for handling hover states for any component.

<entry />

## Usage

 `v-hover` is a renderless component that uses the default slot to provide scoped access to its internal model; as well as mouse event listeners to modify it. To expliclty control the internal state, use the **model-value** property.

## API

<api-inline />

## Examples

### Props

#### Disabled

The **disabled** prop disables the hover functionality.

<example file="v-hover/prop-disabled" />

#### Open and close delay

Delay `v-hover` events by using **open-delay** and **close-delay** props in combination or separately.

<example file="v-hover/prop-open-and-close-delay" />

### Misc

#### Hover list

`v-hover` can be used in combination with `v-for` to make a single item stand out when the user interacts with the list.

<example file="v-hover/misc-hover-list" />

#### Transition

Create highly customized components that respond to user interaction.

<example file="v-hover/misc-transition" />
