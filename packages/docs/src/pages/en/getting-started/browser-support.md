# Browser support

Vuetify is a progressive framework that attempts to push web development to the next level. In order to best accomplish this task, some sacrifices had to be made in terms of support for older versions of Internet Explorer. This is not an exhaustive list of compatible browsers, but the main targeted ones.

## Browsers

| Edge | ✅ Supported |
| Firefox | ✅ Supported |
| Safari 12+ | ✅ Supported |
| IE9 / IE10 / IE11 / Safari 9| ⛔ Not supported |

## Deprecated Browser Support

Vuetify 3 is a next generation framework that takes advantage of the latest web technology features and requires an evergreen browser to function. If you need to support older browsers, we recommend using Vuetify 2.
