# Vuetify 3

Welcome to the Vuetify 3 release. To get started, select an installation method below or review some of the most [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)

## Installation

To get started with Vuetify 3 create a new Vue project using [Vue CLI](#vue-cli). For [Vite preview](#vite), installations, there is an added step you must first use the **create** command using one of the following package managers:

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

We recommend using **yarn**, but any will work just fine. For more information on different installation options for vite, visit the official [installation guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

### Vite

Vite is a build tool from the creator of Vue designed to provide faster and leaner development. It offers significantly lower build and compilation times during development and extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR). The following sections cover how you can create a new vite application for Vue and Vuetify 3.

<v-tabs v-model="tab" color="primary">
  <v-tab value="yarn" variant="plain">Yarn</v-tab>
  <v-tab value="npm" variant="plain">NPM</v-tab>
  <v-tab value="pnpm" variant="plain">PNPM</v-tab>
</v-tabs>
<v-window v-model="tab">
  <v-window-item value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create vite my-app --template vue
```

  </v-window-item>
  <v-window-item value="npm">

<p class="mt-4">Use the following command to check your current version:</p>

```bash
npm -v
```

Note the displayed value to determine the correct installation command. For more information on how to upgrade **npm** on your system, visit the official [Upgrade NPM Page](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm).

For version **7 and above**, an additional "**- -**" is required before specifying the vite template parameters. Use the following code for newer npm versions:

```bash
npm create vite my-vue-app -- --template vue
```

If your npm version is **less than 7**, the extra "**- -**" is not required. Use the following code for older npm versions:

```bash
npm create vite my-vue-app --template vue
```

  </v-window-item>
  <v-window-item value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm create vite my-vue-app -- --template vue
```

  </v-window-item>
</v-window>

----

Once your project is created, navigate to the [Adding Vuetify](#adding-vuetify) section to continue.

### Vue CLI

For more information on how to setup Vue CLI, see the official [installation guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

<alert type="warning">

  Vuetify 3 requires **Vue CLI 5.0** in order to install properly. For more information, visit the Vue CLI [installation guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

</alert>

Generate a new Vue 3 application by entering the following command into your terminal:

```bash
vue create my-vuetify-app
```

When prompted, select the **Vue 3 Preview** preset:

```bash
? Please pick a preset:
    Default ([Vue 2] babel, eslint)
  ❯ Default (Vue 3 Preview) ([Vue 3] babel, eslint)
    Manually select features
```

After choosing your option, **Vue CLI** generates a new Vue 3 project located in the **my-vuetify-app** folder (or whatever name you provided).

<alert type="info">

  Before installing Vuetify, we **recommend** you commit your changes to `git` or whichever source control software you use. This allows you to rollback changes if you encounter an issue.

</alert>

#### Adding Vuetify

Navigate to your new project's folder, and using **Vue CLI**, add the `vuetify` package:

```bash
cd my-vuetify-app
vue add vuetify
```

Once prompted, choose `Vuetify 3 Preview`:

```bash
? Choose a preset:
  Vuetify 2 - Configure Vue CLI (advanced)
  Vuetify 2 - Vue CLI (recommended)
  Vuetify 2 - Prototype (rapid development)
  Vuetify 3 - Vite (preview)
❯ Vuetify 3 - Vue CLI (preview 3)
```

## Usage

With Vue 3.0, the initialization process for Vue apps (and by extension Vuetify) has changed. With the new `createVuetify` method, the options passed to it have also changed. Please see the pages in the Features section of the documentation for further details.

```js { data-resource="main.js" }
import 'vuetify/styles' // Global CSS has to be imported
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify'
import App from './App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)
const vuetify = createVuetify() // Replaces new Vuetify()

app.use(vuetify)

app.mount('#app')
```

Components and directives are no longer included by default, they either have to imported separately or loaded automatically with the appropriate [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-vuetify) or [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-plugin-vuetify) plugin. See [treeshaking](/features/treeshaking) for more information.

```js { data-resource="main.js" }
import * as components from 'vuetify/components'
import * as directives from 'vuetify/directives'

const vuetify = createVuetify({
  components,
  directives,
})
```

Vue 3 has no way to automatically detect if SSR is used &mdash; so nuxt, gridsome, and other SSR frameworks will need to manually set the `ssr` option to `true` in order to properly render the application.

```js { data-resource="main.js" }
const vuetify = createVuetify({
  ssr: true,
})
```

### CDN

We recommend using the latest version of Vuetify 3 from [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). All components and styles are included.

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vuetify@{{ version }}/dist/vuetify.min.css`

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vuetify@{{ version }}/dist/vuetify.min.js`

```js
const { createApp } = Vue
const { createVuetify } = Vuetify

const vuetify = createVuetify()

const app = createApp()
app.use(vuetify).mount('#app')
```
