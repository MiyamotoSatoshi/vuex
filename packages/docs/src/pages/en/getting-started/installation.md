# Get started with Vuetify 3

Get started with Vuetify, the world’s most popular Vue.js framework for building feature rich, blazing fast applications.

<entry />

## Installation

To get started with Vuetify 3, simply paste the following code into your terminal:

```bash
yarn create vuetify
```

This command prompts you with a few options before generating your scaffolded Vue / Vuetify 3 project.

```bash
success Installed "create-vuetify@x.x.x" with binaries:
    - create-vuetify

? Project name: ❯ vuetify-project // the folder to generate your application
? Use TypeScript?: ❯ No / Yes
? Would you like to install dependencies with yarn, npm, or pnpm?:
  ❯ yarn
    npm
    pnpm
    none
```

After making your selections, [create-vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/create-vuetify) will generate the structure for your new application.

Once the scaffold is complete, start the vite development server by running the following commands:

```bash
cd vuetify-project
yarn dev
```

For more information regarding supported package managers, please visit their official websites:

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### SSR

Vue 3 has no way to automatically detect if SSR is used &mdash; so nuxt, gridsome, and other SSR frameworks must manually set the `ssr` option to `true` in order to properly render the application.

```js { data-resource="src/plugins/vuetify.js" }
import '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css'
import 'vuetify/styles'

const vuetify = createVuetify({
  ssr: true,
})
```

## Vue CLI

Vue CLI is currently in maintenance mode and no longer the default tooling used to build Vue applications. Vuetify projects are now generated using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). We plan on enabling the Vue CLI installation path in an official guide in the future.

## Manual steps

Follow these steps if for example you are adding Vuetify to an existing project, or simply do not want to use a scaffolding tool.

`yarn add vuetify@^{{ version }}`

In the file where you create the Vue application, add the following code

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

// Vuetify
import 'vuetify/styles'
import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify'
import * as components from 'vuetify/components'
import * as directives from 'vuetify/directives'

const vuetify = createVuetify({
  components,
  directives,
})

createApp(App).use(vuetify).mount('#app')
```

This will include all components and directives regardless of whether or not you are using them. If you instead only want to include used components, have a look at the [Vite](https://npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-vuetify) or [Webpack](https://npmjs.com/package/webpack-plugin-vuetify) plugins, depending on your setup. The plugins also makes it possible to customize SCSS variables.

Lastly, do not forget to install [icons](/features/icon-fonts/).

## CDN

We recommend using the latest version of Vuetify 3 from [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). All components and styles are included.

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vuetify@{{ version }}/dist/vuetify.min.css` { .text-truncate }

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vuetify@{{ version }}/dist/vuetify.min.js` { .text-truncate }

```js
const { createApp } = Vue
const { createVuetify } = Vuetify

const vuetify = createVuetify()

const app = createApp()
app.use(vuetify).mount('#app')
```

## Using Laravel Mix

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

// Vuetify
import '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css'
import 'vuetify/styles'
import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify'
import * as components from 'vuetify/components'
import * as directives from 'vuetify/directives'

const vuetify = createVuetify({
  components,
  directives
})

createApp(App).use(vuetify).mount('#app')
```

To import the fonts you need to add to webpack.mix.js:

```js
mix.copy('node_modules/@mdi/font/fonts/', 'dist/fonts/')
```

## Exposed exports

### JS

| Name                             | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vuetify`                        | Main entry point. Contains `createVuetify()` and public composables.                                                                               |
| `vuetify/styles`                 | Precompiled global CSS (reset, utilities, etc.), no component styles. Will be redirected to SASS if `styles.configFile` is set in vite or webpack. |
| `vuetify/components`             | All components. Not recommended as it will include all components during development, slowing down your build.                                     |
| `vuetify/components/<name>`      | Individual components. Grouped by top-level name, for example VListItem, VListGroup, and VListItemTitle are all in `vuetify/components/VList`.     |
| `vuetify/directives`             | All directives.                                                                                                                                    |
| `vuetify/directives/<name>`      | Individual directives.                                                                                                                             |
| `vuetify/blueprints/<name>`      | Preset collections of prop defaults.                                                                                                               |
| `vuetify/locale`                 | Translations for strings in vuetify components. Each language is a named export.                                                                   |
| `vuetify/locale/adapters/<name>` | Adapters to retrieve translations from other libraries such as vue-i18n.                                                                           |
| `vuetify/iconsets/<name>`        | Icon presets, see [Icon Fonts](/features/icon-fonts/)                                                                                              |

### SASS

See [SASS Variables](/features/sass-variables/) for more information.

| Name               | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vuetify`          | Global CSS (reset, utilities, etc.), no component styles. Equivalent to `vuetify/styles` in JS. |
| `vuetify/settings` | All SASS variables, including component variables.                                              |
| `vuetify/tools`    | Mixins and functions.                                                                           |

## Nightly Builds

The three development branches (`master`, `dev`, and `next`) are automatically published to NPM at 1200 UTC under the [`@vuetify/nightly`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vuetify/nightly?activeTab=versions) namespace. They may be outdated or buggy and are therefore not officially supported and are only supplied for testing purposes. These builds can be installed with a [package alias](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install#:~:text=Install%20a%20package%20under%20a%20custom%20alias).
