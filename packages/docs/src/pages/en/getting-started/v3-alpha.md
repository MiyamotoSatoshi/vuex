- **How can I install the alpha?** { #installation }

  Installation of the alpha is limited to new cli projects at this time and intended primarily for testing. To get started you read the [Vuetify v3 Alpha install](/getting-started/installation/#vuetify-v3-alpha-install) instructions.

- **What is included in the alpha?** { #included }

  Currently most base functionality of Vuetify is included in the alpha. This includes core services such as theme, configuration, and layout. A small subset of base components are also included such as grid system, sheets, and buttons. For full list of available components, visit the **UI Component** and **API** sections.

- **When will Vuetify v3 be released?** { #version-3 }

  Version 3 is currently under development. Alpha is the first step toward this. Follow our progress via our project on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/vuetifyjs/projects/7) or read and overview of what's to come on our [Roadmap](/introduction/roadmap/).

## How to report an issue or bug

For bugs related to the Alpha, please create a issue via our [Issue Generator](https://issues.vuetifyjs.com/). At this time we are only accepting bugs for the following:

- Vuetify components and functions available in the Alpha
- Documentations content

<alert type="info">

  We ask that documentation issues remain related to content only. The `next` documentation is a work in progress and not fully updated to Vue 3. Some features may be missing or not functioning and will be constantly worked on as new components and functionality becomes available. We will begin fielding these bugs closer to Phase 3 as things become stable.
