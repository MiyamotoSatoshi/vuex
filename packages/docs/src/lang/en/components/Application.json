  "headingText": "In Vuetify, the `v-app` component and the **app** prop on components like `v-navigation-drawer`, `v-app-bar`, `v-footer` and more, help bootstrap your application with the proper sizing around `<v-content>` component. This allows you to create truly unique interfaces without the hassle of managing your layout sizing. The `v-app` component is **REQUIRED** for all applications. This is the mount point for many of Vuetify's components and functionality and ensures that it propagates the default application _variant_ (**dark/light**) to children components and also ensures proper cross-browser support for certain click events in browsers like Safari. `v-app` should only be used within your application **ONCE**.",
  "markupHeader": "## Default application markup",
  "markupText": "This is an example of the default application markup for Vuetify. You can place your layout elements anywhere, as long as you apply the **app** property. The key component in all of this is `v-content`. This will be dynamically sized depending upon the structure of your designated **app** components. You can use combinations of any or all of the above components including `v-bottom-navigation`.",
  "markupText2": "When using [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) it is recommended that you place your views inside `v-content`.",
  "alert1": "In order for your application to work properly, you **must** wrap it in a `v-app` component. This component is required for ensuring proper **cross-browser compatibility**. Vuetify doesn't support multiple isolated Vuetify instances on a page. `v-app` can exist **anywhere** inside the body of your app, however, there should only be one and it must be the parent of **ALL** Vuetify components.",
  "alert2": "Applying the **app** prop automatically applies position: **fixed** to the layout element. If your application calls for an _absolute_ element, you can overwrite this functionality by using the **absolute** prop.",
  "componentHeader": "## Application components",
  "componentText1": "Below is a list of all the components that support the **app** prop and can be used as layout elements in your application. These can be mixed and matched and only **one** of each particular component should exist at any time. You can, however, swap them out and the layout will accommodate. For some examples displaying how you can build various layouts, checkout the [Pre-made layouts](/getting-started/pre-made-layouts) page.",
