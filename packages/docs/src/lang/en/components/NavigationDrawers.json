  "headingText": "The `v-navigation-drawer` component is what your users will utilize to navigate through the application. The navigation-drawer is pre-configured to work with or without **vue-router** right out the box. For the purpose of display, some examples are wrapped in a `v-card` element. Within your application you will generally place the `v-navigation-drawer` as a direct child of `v-app`.",
  "examples": {
    "usage": {
      "desc": "The navigation drawer is primarily used to house links to the pages in your application. Using `null` as the starting value for its `v-model` will initialize the drawer as closed on mobile and as open on desktop. It is common to pair drawers with the [v-list](/components/lists) component using the **nav** property."
    },
    "colored": {
      "heading": "### Colored drawer",
      "desc": "Navigation drawers can be customized to fit any application's design. Here we apply a custom background color and an appended content area using the **append** slot."

    "permanent-floating": {
      "heading": "### Permanent floating drawer",
      "desc": "By default, a navigation drawer has a 1px right border that separates it from content. In this example we want to detach the drawer from the left side and let it float on its own. The **floating** property removes the right border (or left if using **right**)."
    },
    "mini": {
      "heading": "### Mini",
      "desc": "When using the **mini-variant** prop, the drawer will shrink (default 80px) and hide everything inside of `v-list` except the first element. In this example we use the **.sync** modifier that allows us to tie the expanding/contracting of the drawer programmatically."
    },
    "temporary": {
      "heading": "### Temporary",
      "desc": "A temporary drawer sits above its application and uses a scrim (overlay) to darken the background. This drawer behavior is mimicked by default when on mobile. Clicking outside of the drawer will cause it to close."

      "heading": "### Combined drawers",

      "heading": "### Right positioned",
      "desc": "Navigation drawers can also be positioned on the right side of your application (or an element). This is also useful for creating a side-sheet with auxillary information that may not have any navigation links. When using **RTL** you must explicitly define **right** for your drawer."
    },
    "background": {
      "heading": "### Backgrounds",
      "desc": "Apply a custom background to your drawer. If you need to customize `v-img`'s properties you can use the **img** slot."

      "heading": "### Expand on hover",
