  "headingText": "Out of the box you get access to all colors in the [Material Design spec](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html) through **sass** and **javascript**. These values can be used within your style sheets, your component files and on actual components via the **color class** system.",
  "classesHeader": "## Classes",
  "classesText": "Each color from the spec gets converted to a **background** and **text** variant for styling within your application through a class, e.g. `<div class=\"red\">` or `<span class=\"red--text\">`. These class colors are defined [here](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/blob/master/packages/vuetify/src/styles/settings/_colors.scss).",

  "javascriptPackText": "Vuetify has an optional javascript color pack that you can import and use within your application. This can also be used to help define your application's theme.",
  "sassPackHeader": "## Sass color pack",
  "sassPackText": "While convenient, the color pack increases the CSS export size by ~30kb. Some projects may only require the default provided classes that are created at run-time from the Vuetify bootstrap. To disable this feature, you will have to _manually_ import and build the main **sass** file. This will require a [Sass loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) and a `.sass`/`.scss` file entry.",
  "sassPackText2": "Your created `main.sass` file will then need to be included in your project.",
  "alert": "You **must** configure your webpack setup to use `sass`. If you are using a [pre-made template](/getting-started/quick-start#new-applications) this will already be done for you.",
  "sassPackText3": "This can also be done within your main **App.vue** file. Keep in mind, depending on your project setup, this _will_ increase build times as every time your entry file is updated, the Sass files will be re-generated.",
