  "header": "# Accessibility",
  "headerText": "Web accessibility **(a11y for short)**, is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent the interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with disabilities. Vuetify components are built to provide keyboard interactions for all mouse-based actions and utilize HTML5 semantic elements where applicatable.",
  "accessibilityHeader": "## Material Design Accessibility",
  "accessibilityText": "Google provides a detailed overview on how their components are created with a11y in mind. They also provide examples of how you can ensure that you are using best practices when creating applications (beyond what is supported by default with Vuetify). You can find more information about [implementing accessibility](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html) on the specification site.",
  "activatorHeader": "## Activator slots",
  "activatorText1": "Vuetify uses activator slots for many components such as `v-menu`, `v-dialog` and more. In some instances these activator elements should have specific a11y attributes that associate them with their corresponding content. In order to achieve this, we pass down the necessary a11y options through the slots scope.",
  "activatorText2": "When the activator element is rendered, it will now contain the bound a11y attributes:",
  "focusHeader1": "## Focus management and keyboard interactions",
  "focusText1": "Beyond attributes, components such as `v-menu` also support interaction by pressing <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> for navigating between options.",
  "focusHeader2": "### v-menu",
  "focusText2": "When inside of a `v-menu`, `v-list-item` will be automatically configured to have a role of **menuitem**. Navigate to the [Menu](/components/menus) for more information on the components features.",
  "focusHeader3": "### v-list-item-group",
  "focusText3": "The `v-list-item-group` component makes `v-list-item` interactable and navigatable when pressing the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. It also configures `v-list-item` to have a role of **listitem**. Navigate to the [List-item group](/components/list-item-groups) for more information on the components features.",
  "scopedHeader1": "## Item slots",
  "scopedText1": "There are some instances where you utilize a slot for a component and will need the correct aria attributes to bind to your elements. When using (**v-slot**) this is passed down to you in the slots scope, as the `v-menu` example above demonstrated. However, there are other components that are more complex in which you will need to bind attributes to the correct components to ensure proper support.",
  "scopedHeader2": "### v-select",
  "scopedText2": "The `v-select` component will automatically configure all required a11y attributes. Each item will generate a corresponding **id**, **aria-labelledby**, **aria-selected** and **roles** by default",
  "scopedText3": "When rendered, the `v-select` component's content will look similar to this:",
  "scopedText4": "However, when using slots there are conditions in which you will need to utilize the passed down properties to get the proper aria setup. This information also applies to `v-autocomplete`, `v-combobox` and `v-overflow-btn` as they all extend the `v-select` component.",
  "scopedText5": "When providing a `v-list-item` component in a slot, the aria attributes are passed through the **attrs** data property and can be bound with `v-bind`.",
  "scopedText6": "In order to properly associate a label with the correct _option_ you will need to bind `attrs.id` to the `aria-labelled-by` on your `v-list-item-title`. This will ensure that the text is properly associated. Keep in mind, this is done automatically for you if you are not using slots.",
  "resourcesHeader": "## Additional Resources",
  "resourcesText1": "While Vuetify attempts to make a11y as easy as possible in your application, there are times where additional information is needed. Below you can find a list of helpful resources.",
