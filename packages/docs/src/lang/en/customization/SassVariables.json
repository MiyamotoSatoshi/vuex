  "headerText": "Starting with version **2.0**, Vuetify is built using **SASS/SCSS**. Using the data option in your `vue.config.js`, we can also pass in custom variables. A list of available variables is located in each components' folder. In order to build the SASS file, you will need to configure your application to support [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) and [Fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers).",
  "sassAlert1": "Note: SCSS/SASS variables are only supported using [A-la-carte installation](/customization/a-la-carte).",
  "sassHeader2": "## Setup",
  "sassText2": "In the command line, run:",
  "sassText3": "This will setup the dependencies needed to import and parse SASS/SCSS files. Once installed, create a folder called `sass` in your src directory (or appropriate assets directory) with a file named `main.scss`. Keep in mind many of the Vuetify variables are using [SASS Lists](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#lists) and must be updated with [map-merge](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#map_merge-instance_method) as demonstrated below:",
  "sassText3a": "Now setup your **vue.config.js** file to load the file through the data option of the sass loader:",
  "sassText4": "The next time you run **yarn run serve**, Vue CLI 3 will inject the variables file and your changes will be represented in your application.",
  "sassAlert2": "If you are requiring the Vuetify stylesheet by a `<link>` tag in your index file, remove it.",
  "sassText5": "Under the hood, the new variables will be hoisted to the top of the compiled styles and used to override the default behavior.",
  "sfcHeader": "## Single-file components",
  "sfcText1": "Using the above configuration you will also be able to access Vuetify variables in SFC files when using style blocks with `lang=\"sass\"`. However if you wish to use `lang=\"scss\"`, an extra step is necessary.",
  "sfcText2": "When Vue CLI 3 compiles styles, by default it does not differentiate between file types for SASS, (**.scss** and **.sass**). Due to this, and the above configuration, when adding custom styles in a SFC with `lang=\"scss\"`, it will throw an error saying that a _semi-colon_ must be added to the import statement. However if you add this _semi-colon_ to the existing configuration, it will tell you to remove it. This is due to the fact that Vuetify uses both **.scss** and **.sass** files internally.",
  "sfcText3": "In order to solve this, we have to tell webpack to explicitly use an import statement that includes the semi-colon when encountering **scss** code."
